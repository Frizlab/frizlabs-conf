aliases:
   # This is a work alias, but for simplicity I allow it in the global config.
   # The alternative would be to have a template, which is annoying because the config would no longer be an alias in ~/.config,
   #  or have two different files with the proper one being chosen at install time, which is annoying because both files would be practically the same.
   # (Second alternative is not supported yet but not complicated to implement.)
   # If the two config for home and work gh would differ much at some point we might migrate to the second alternative.
