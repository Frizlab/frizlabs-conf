# Install an admin-owned Homebrew.


# ⚠️ IMPORTANT
# If it is needed, the install will probably fail, because we do not ask for sudo.
# Will we ask for it one day? Maybe.
# But right now we do not.
#
# A trick to get sudo during the duration of the script:
# https://github.com/nnja/new-computer/blob/master/setup.sh#L73
#    sudo -v
#    while true; do sudo -n true; sleep 60; kill -0 "$$" || exit; done 2>/dev/null &
#
#
# Another thing: Installing homebrew in /usr/local is not supported by the script we use to install homebrew.
# Homebrew workarounds /usr/local not being writable without sudo by installing itself in /usr/local/Homebrew instead and
#  creating only the required folders in /usr/local and
#  symlinking stuff from the Homebrew folder to the expected folders.
#
# Basically the install should be done more or less this way:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh simplified
#    cd /usr/local
#    directories=(bin etc include lib sbin share var opt
#                 share/zsh share/zsh/site-functions
#                 var/homebrew var/homebrew/linked
#                 Cellar Caskroom Homebrew Frameworks)
#    for d in $directories; do sudo mkdir "$d"; done
#    for d in $directories; do sudo chown -h frizlab:staff "$d"; done
#    curl -SL https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C /usr/local/Homebrew
#    ln -sf /usr/local/Homebrew/bin/brew /usr/local/bin/brew
#    /usr/local/bin/brew update --force
#
# We should modify the script so it supports installing to a custom homebrew prefix, with a custom install folder
#  (untar in custom install folder, and create necessary directories in homebrew prefix, then link brew, then brew update).
