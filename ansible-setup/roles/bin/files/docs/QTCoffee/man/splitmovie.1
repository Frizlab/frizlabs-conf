.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Splits a QuickTime movie into a set of output movies, either all of the same duration (except, possibly, the last) or at specified times.
.
.Sh USAGE
.Nm Ar in.mov Fl duration Ar timevalue Fl o Ar out.mov
.Pp
This splits the movie into equal length pieces of the specified duration. The last piece may be shorter.
.Pp
.Nm Ar in.mov Fl numPieces Ar num Fl o Ar out.mov
.Pp
This splits the movie into
.Ar num
equal length pieces.
.Pp
.Nm Ar in.mov Fl splitAt Ar time1 Fl splitAt Ar time2 Fl o Ar out.mov
.Pp
This splits the movie at the times specified in the
.Fl splitAt
options.
The output files will be named
.Dq out-1.mov ,
.Dq out-2.mov ,
.Dq out-3.mov ,
etc.
The files are numbered so that they sort correctly in the shell and in the Finder. The movies have the same settings (time scale, annotations, matrix, etc.) as the input movie.
.Pp
Typically, one would perform some modifications to one or more of the movies using
.Xr modmovie 1
and then concatenate them back together using
.Xr catmovie 1
with a command line such as
catmovie out*.mov -o fixed.mov.
.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl q
Be quiet: do not print informational messages.
.
.It Fl o Ar outputFileBaseName
Send output to files whose names are based on the specified file. The filenames consist of the base file name (minus a 
.Dq .mov ,
.Dq mp4 ,
or other extension if present) followed by a dash, followed by the file number, and then the 
extension (if it was present).
If any of the files exist, they are replaced without warning. If no
.Fl o
option is given, the files are placed on the Desktop with names based on 
.Dq out.mov
or
.Dq out.mp4.
.
.It Fl mp4
If the input file contains only MPEG-4 audio (AAC) and/or MPEG-4 video then it is likely that an MPEG-4 output file can be created (without lossy conversion) via this option.
.
.It Fl self-contained
By default, 
.Nm
behaves as QuickTime Pro does when selecting 
.Dq Save movie normally,
producing small pointer files that do not contain that actual sound and video data, but instead refer to the data
in the original movie file. This option copies all necessary information into the destination movies, making
them stand-alone. In addition, it
makes the movies 
.Dq fast-start
which means that when placed on a web page the movie can start playing before
being downloaded fully. It also compresses the movie header for faster download response. 
.
.It Fl no-fast-start
When used with
.Fl self-contained
this prevents the output movie from being fast start. This is faster, and does not require temporary extra disk space; the file will not be suitable to web download.
.
.It Fl no-compressed-header
When used with
.Fl self-contained
this prevents compression of the movie header. Rarely useful.
.
.It Fl name-from-stdin
The filename is taken from standard input instead of the command line. 
Useful when the filename contains
special characters that the shell has trouble with. Also useful in scripts when the filename contains spaces.
.
.It Fl 
A single 
.Fl 
indicates that option processing is over and the next command line argument is the
filename. Useful when the filename begins with a 
.Dq \-
character.

.Sh BUGS
.Bl -dash
.It
.Nm
overwrites its output files without warning
.It
.Nm
only works if the user is logged-in to the console. This appears to be a 
limitation of QuickTime itself.
.It
.Nm
has really bad error messages.
.El
.
.Sh FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
The following are possible improvements we are considering. We will invest resources according to the feedback we receive.
.Bl -dash
.It
Fix bugs listed above.
.It
Allow for a more flexible output file naming scheme.
