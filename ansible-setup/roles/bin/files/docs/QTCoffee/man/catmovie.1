.Sh NAME
.Nm catmovie
.Nd concatenate QuickTime movies
.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm Op GLOBAL OPTIONS 
.Ar file1 
.Op File specific options 
.Ar file2
.Op File specific options
.Ar ...
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Concatenates a series of QuickTime movies (or any QuickTime readable file format) one after another, 
optionally performing modifications to each movie before appending it.
.
.Sh USAGE
The simplest usage is
.Nm Ar file1 file2 ... fileN Fl o Ar outputFile
which will concatenate the movies in 
.Ar file1 
through 
.Ar fileN
and place the output in 
.Ar outputFile . 
.Ar outputFile
will be a pointer movie: it will not contain the actual movie data, but will refer to
the original files. Use the 
.Fl self-contained
option to include all necessary data in a single file.
.Pp
The settings of the output movie (such as scaling, auto-play, annotations, time scale, and other movie specific properties)
are taken from the first input movie, unless the 
.Fl use-settings
option is used. Tracks and movies can be scaled, rotated, and translated; the movies can be edited; playback rates can be changed; chapters markers can be added. There are also options that control which tracks and chapters of the movies to process.  If the file from which the settings are taken has iTunes tags (such as AAC and protected AAC files), 
.Nm
does its best to convert those tags into a format suitable for QuickTime movies. See the section
.Sx ITUNES TAGS
for more information.
.Pp
Any QuickTime readable format, including MPEG and AVI movies,
and many audio and still image formats will work. With third party plug-ins many other formats (such as WMV and Ogg) can be manipulated. All such files will be referred to as
.Dq movies
below.

.Dq iTunesJoin
shareware package, a series of scripts for iTunes that leverage the power of
.Nm QTCoffee
in an easy to use manner.
.
.Sh OPTIONS
Some options are global: they affect the behavior of
.Nm catmovie
or the output movie. These options can appear anywhere on the command-line, though they are usually placed at the beginning or at the end. Some options affect the input movies; they can be either global (if they appear before any movies are mentioned on the command-line) or file-specific (if they appear after a particular file they apply only to that file).
.Pp
For detailed information on the options, please look at the Read Me file. If you have a default install, you can access the Read Me by typing

.Sh ITUNES TAGS
QuickTime files can contain tags, but these tags are somewhat limited. 
For that reason, iTunes uses a special format for the tags in AAC and protected AAC files. However neither QuickTime Player nor iTunes recognizes those tags when present in an ordinary QuickTime movie (which is what
.Nm
produces).
When QuickTime opens an MP3 file (which uses its own tag format), it converts, to best of its ability, the tags into QuickTime format, but it does not do the same for AAC files. 
By default, when 
.Nm
encounters such tags, it does its best to convert the tags into standard QuickTime tags. Both QuickTime Player and iTunes will recognize the QuickTime tags. But there are numerous bugs in both QuickTime Player and iTunes for tags with non-Roman characters (this applies both to MP3 tags as well as the special conversion applied by these tools). Moreover,
several iTunes fields, such as BPM, cover art, and disk number, cannot be represented by QuickTime tags and will not be carried over.
Because of these limitations,
.Nm
leaves the original tags in place (in case Apple someday decides to support them in QuickTime movies).
It is possible that the tag conversion will cause problems or that you don't want the old tags to remain in the file. 
.Nm
offers options to control the conversion of tags. 
.Pp
Tag conversion is not available with the
.Fl mp4
option because Apple has not made available to others the method by which iTunes includes tags in AAC files.
.Pp
QuickTime 7 has a new tag format and supports iTunes tags. A future version of
.Nm
will take advantage of this.
.Pp
If you are joining iTunes music, you may wish to download 3AM Coffee Software's shareware package of iTunes scripts
.Dq iTunesJoin
which integrates
.Nm
with iTunes via Applescript to handle tags intelligently, and without the fuss of the command-line.
.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl catmovie *.m4a -o allsongs.mov
Concatenates all the AAC files (which usually have a .m4a extension) into the single output file
allsongs.mov. 
The tags of the output movie will be converted from those in the first song.
Note that the output is a QuickTime movie file, not another AAC file, so iTunes will be able to play it
but an iPod will not. 
.Pp
.Dl catmovie *.m4a -mp4 -o allsongs.m4a
Concatenates all the AAC files and outputs the MPEG-4 audio content to the file
.Dq allsongs.m4a . 
The output file will not have any tags. Note that this procedure may fail, in which case see
.Xr QTCoffee 1
for more information.
.Pp
.Dl catmovie -list movie1.mov movie2.mov
.Dl catmovie -notrack Do Sound Track Dc movie1.mov movie2.mov
The first command is used to get a listing of the tracks in the two movies. It also concatenates them, sending output to
the file 
out.mov
on the Desktop, but we don't care about that. Assume we discover that the audio track is named 
.Do Sound Track Dc
in both movies. The second command then concatenates the movies without their audio tracks, and places
the result into out.mov on the Desktop.

.Sh VERSION
1.2.5
.
.Sh BUGS
.Bl -dash
.It
.Nm
overwrites its output file without warning
.It
.Nm
cannot distinguish tracks or chapters with the same name.
.It
.Nm
only works if the user is logged-in to the console. This appears to be a 
limitation of QuickTime itself.
.It
.Nm
has really bad error messages.
.It
.Nm
does not do well converting non-Roman tags. We believe this to be because of bugs in QuickTime and iTunes. This will probably be corrected when we move to the use of QuickTime 7's new tag support.
.It
.Nm
does not convert certain iTunes tags, such as BPM, cover art, and disc number. As far as we know, QuickTime does not have a way to represent such tags, so conversion is impossible.
.It
The 
.Fl unique-tracks
and
.Fl force-same-tracks
options causes relationships between tracks (such as chapter tracks or volume modifier tracks) to be lost.
.It
We never thought about what should happen if you mix 
.Fl track
and 
.Fl notrack
options or 
.Fl chapter
and 
.Fl nochapter
options on the same command line, hence we don't really know what will happen. It might do what you expect, it might not. (It certainly won't hurt anything, though.)
.El
.
.Sh FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
The following are possible improvements we are considering. We will invest resources according to the feedback we receive.
.Bl -dash
.It
Fix bugs listed above.
.It
Add new options for scaling the size of a movie, such as
.Fl sscaleTo
to scale to a specific number of pixels.
.It
Add more modification options, such as playback volume, sheering and other complex matrix modifications, modification of annotation (tag) data, auto-play attributes, etc.
.It
Allow addition of QuickTime transition effects and audio fading between movies.
