# Frizlab’s Conf
Use at your own risks.

Heavily based on [wincent’s conf](https://github.com/wincent/wincent) for the
Ansible setup.

Run `./run-ansible help` for info. Note that Python3 is required for all of this
to work:
```
Ansible works fine with Python 2, and Python 2 is the only Python
installed on macOS by default. Would it make sense to use Python2
instead of Python 3? Yes. However I consider Python 2 as obsolete
(and so does Python: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/).
Thus, I force the usage of Python 3 whenever I can…

AFAIK, there should only be the inventory.py script (in this repo) and
the virtualenv setup (in run-ansible) that should have to be modified
to have everything working with Python2, if need be.
```
